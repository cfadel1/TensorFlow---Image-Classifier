# Image Classifier
A program for classifying images based on given datasets.

## Libraries
Each library can be installed using the command `pip install $LIBRARY_NAME`.

1. Matplotlib

 Caveat: If the installation gives a runtime error on macOS: `RuntimeError: Python is not installed as a framework.`, you will need to create a file `~/.matplotlib/matplotlibrc` and add the line `backend:TkAgg` to solve the error.

2. Sklearn

 Caveat: This library requries `SciPy` to also be installed.
